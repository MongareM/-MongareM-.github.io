<h1>Hey you! <b>Welcome to my blog</b>!
<p> I am a young developer who has just taken up HTML and CSS and is self-learning. I have no experience whatsoever in coding but I have commited myself with the <b>#100daysofcode</b> challenge to learn these two. I will keep coming here to update this blog on the daily challenges that I will be undertaking. I look forward to a beautiful experience.</p>
