<p> Hi! I want to learn how to code using HTML. I have since started with one learn-as-you-do project by creating  my first webpage.
  I used HTML and CSS on Sublime Text to come up with the webpage."
  The reason I am doing this is to not only learn marketable skills but also be in a position to impact societal change through information provision. 
  I am a social scientist and understand the value that information (or the lack thereof) can create within the society. 
  I will keep this up by committing to the #100days of code challenge. </p>
<p> Happy Coding Bro!</p>
